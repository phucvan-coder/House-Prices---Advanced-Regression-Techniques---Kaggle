# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
In this notebook, I will try to predict the sales house prices and practice with feature engineering.

## 1. Loading Dataset
The first stage is loading dataset and we can do it by using pandas library.

We have training dataset (1460 rows and 81 columns) and testing dataset (1459 rows and 80 columns).

## 2. Data Visualization
The next stage is data visualization, we can draw the histogram and boxplot to check the skew and outliers of each feature.

There are many outliers in the dataset, we will keep them because we do not want to lose the important information. 
In order to handle outliers, we can use cross-validation technique. 

## 3. Merge Train and Test
Next stage, we will merge training dataset and testing dataset for data preprocessing, then we will split the data before building model.

## 4. Handling Missing Values
